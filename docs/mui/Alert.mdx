# Alert

When the component is dynamically displayed, the content is automatically
announced by most screen readers with the default `role="alert"`. At this time,
screen readers do not inform users of alerts that are present when the page loads.

For content that should be called out to the user but is not an alert, use `<Admonition>`.

<Stories title="" />
