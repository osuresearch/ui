# Style System

Many components in Research UI are configured using style system properties that allow you to set the margins, padding, colors, and other standard CSS styles on each component.

The style system is opinionated to make easier to stay within design guidelines for non-designers.


## Spacing

Each component using the style system has a set of poroperties to modify spacing:

|Prop|CSS Equivalent||Prop|CSS Equivalent
|---|---|---|---|---
|m|<code>margin: N N N N</code>||p|<code>padding: N N N N</code>
|mt|<code>margin-top: N</code>||pt|<code>padding-top: N</code>
|mb|<code>margin-bottom: N</code>||pb|<code>padding-bottom: N</code>
|mr|<code>margin-right: N</code>||pr|<code>padding-right: N</code>
|ml|<code>margin-left: N</code>||pl|<code>padding-left: N</code>
|mx|<code>margin: 0 N</code>||px|<code>padding: 0 N</code>
|my|<code>margin: N 0</code>||py|<code>padding: N 0</code>

Property values in the style system are based on T-shirt sizes `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl` to enforce standard spacing values between components.


## Colors

Each component using the style system has properties to modify colors:

|Prop|CSS Equivalent
|---|---
|c|<code>color: N</code>
|bgc|<code>background-color: N</code>

These properties only accept colors from our palette, such as `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `teal` and so forth.

Make sure that when you are picking a color that the contrasting color meetings WCAG AA contrast requirements in both light and dark mode. Most theme colors come with a ready to use contrast value, such as `primary-contrast` or `success-contrast`.


## Responsive Properties

Many components in Research UI support an object syntax for props that specify a different value depending on the responsive breakpoint. All spacing, sizing, and color props support responsive values.

If you wanted to reduce the padding and font size of a component for smaller screens, you can supply the properties as mappings between breakpoints and values.

Resize your window to see the responsive font and padding changes:

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Card withBorder>
    <Text as="p" pb={{ md: 'xs', lg: 'md' }} fs={{ md: 'sm', lg: 'base' }}>
      Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
    </Text>
    <Text as="p" fs={{ md: 'sm', lg: 'base' }}>
      We build healthier, more vibrant communities with the belief that all things are possible our students grow into educated citizens, compassionate community members, critical thinkers and creative problem solvers.
    </Text>
  </Card>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Text as="p" pb={{ md: 'xs', lg: 'md' }} fs={{ md: 'sm', lg: 'base' }}>
  Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
</Text>
```

Research UI's breakpoints are mobile first: responsive props apply at that breakpoint and above. For example, the `lg` breakpoint is applied at screen sizes 960px and wider.

If the screen is smaller than all included breakpoints, then the value is `undefined` for that property.

Color properties (`c`, `bgc`) also follow a similar responsive object pattern to respond to theme changes to make color decisions based on the user's current theme.

Toggle your theme to watch the text color change:

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Card withBorder>
    <Text as="p" c={{ light: 'teal', dark: 'gold' }}>
      Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
    </Text>
  </Card>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Text as="p" c={{ light: 'teal', dark: 'gold' }}>
  Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
</Text>
```
