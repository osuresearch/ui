# Iconography

Default icons and illustrations are provided by [@osuresearch/iconography](https://github.com/osuresearch/iconography).
This provides basic system icons, navigation icons, and illustrations for typical applications.

For a full list, check out the Storybook for the iconography project.


## Extending the icon set

To add new icons for your application, you can extend the iconography library with additional icons from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

Start by installing the icon pack you want from iconify:

```sh
yarn add -D @iconify/icons-mdi
```

Then add an `icons.ts` file to your application that registers your new icons with the iconography library:

```ts
import { addIcon } from '@osuresearch/iconography';

// Import icons you want to use for this app.
// Use semantic names for your icons. For example, instead of "bell-outline"
// or "cog-filled", use "alerts" and "settings".
import tableOfContents from '@iconify/icons-mdi/book-open-outline';
import comment from '@iconify/icons-mdi/comment-outline';
import addComment from '@iconify/icons-mdi/comment-plus-outline'
import settings from '@iconify/icons-mdi/cog-filled';

const icons: Record<string, any> = {
  tableOfContents,
  comment,
  addComment,
  settings,
}

// Add an export that loads all your icons into the registry
export function loadAllIcons() {
  Object.keys(icons).forEach((name) => {
    addIcon(name, icons[name]);
  });
}
```

Import your icons file and execute `loadAllIcons()` wherever your root component for your app is. For a NextJS app, this may be your `_app.tsx`.

Icons can then be used exactly as they were named in the dictionary:

```tsx
<Icon name="tableOfContents" />
```

Remember to follow best practices when picking new icons to ensure that they fit existing icons in your application.
