# Polymorphic Components

Some of our components, such as `Button` and `Text`, accept an `as` prop that allows you to
change the root element. This guide will explain how to correctly use them
with HTML elements, custom components, and TypeScript.

If you are not familiar with the concept of polymorphic components, check out this tutorial from freeCodeCamp:

[Intermediate TypeScript and React Handbook - How to Build Strongly Typed Polymorphic Components](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-with-react-and-typescript/)

## Why use polymorphics

Often you will want to use specific components that visually or interactively match your design but the root component is not semantically allowed for accessibility.

Take for example a card with a button that links the user to another website:

<Paper withBorder bgc="surface-subtle" p="md" w={220}>
  <Text as="p" pb="md">
    Some blurb here!
  </Text>

  <Button as="a" variant="primary" href="https://research.osu.edu" target="_blank">
    Visit research.osu.edu
  </Button>
</Paper>

We want it to visually look like a button, but semantically it has to be an anchor to be WCAG compliant.

Another example would be to want a component to visually look like a heading to a sighted user, but to semantically not be a heading for screen readers for one reason or another, such as noncompliant heading skips.

```tsx
<Heading level={1}>Article heading</Heading>
<Text as={Heading} level={4}>
  Subtitle that should not be a semantic heading
</Text>

<Heading level={2}>Level 2 content heading</Heading>
<Text>And your article content</Text>
```


## As HTML elements

You can use any HTML element in the `as` prop, for example a button polymorphed to the anchor element will still retain the visual appearance of a button but functionally perform as an anchor:

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Button as="a" href="https://research.osu.edu">
    Go to research.osu.edu
  </Button>
</Canvas>

```tsx
import { Button } from '@osuresearch/ui';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <Button as="a" href="https://research.osu.edu">
      Go to research.osu.edu
    </Button>
  );
}
```


## Usage with React Router v6

You can polymorph our buttons and links into React Router components to easily integrate with their router:

```tsx
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button } from '@osuresearch/ui';

export function HomeButton() {
  return (
    <Button as={NavLink} to="/">Home</Button>
  )
}
```

## TypeScript edge cases

In some cases, polymorphic components cannot infer ref and events correctly. When this happens, specify the component type in the generic form:

```tsx
<Box<'button'>
  as="button"
  onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}
  ref={(node) => console.log(node)}
  {...args}
>
  button element
</Box>
```


## Create your own polymorphic components

We provide a `polymorphicForwardRef` utility to allow you to construct your own polymorphic components. Wrap your component with a `<Box>` and pass down your polymorphic `as` element:

```tsx
import { polymorphicForwardRef } from '@osuresearch/ui';

export type MyCustomButtonProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const MyCustomButton = polymorphicForwardRef<'button', MyCustomButtonProps>(
  ({ as, children, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Box as={as || 'button'}>
      {children}
    </Box>
  )
);
```
